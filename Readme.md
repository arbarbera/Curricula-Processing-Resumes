### Hello!
- This project is a didactic attempt to describe a practical application of the python libraries NTLK, pumbpdf and wordcloud, for processing resumes to be included in a list of descriptive profiles of jobs (vacancies) normally advertised in large circulation vehicles, or broadcast on the social networks.
- It is, therefore, a step-by-step approach, but it assumes that the reader has the basic knowledge of Python and some familiarity with the jargon used in the recruitment processes.

See you...
